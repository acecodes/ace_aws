#AWS Scripts by Ace
----------
This is a collection of scripts I use to interact with Amazon Web Services. The Amazon Command Line Interface is required for these scripts to function correctly, so be sure you download and install that before trying to run anything. You'll also need to have your AWS authorizations set up, as I'm (obviously) not going to post mine to a public repo.
